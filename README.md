Background
All companies make a choice and the strategy is materialized in a specific portfolio, with a defined number of customers that will be served through a specific pricing strategy and from which the supply chain will be alligned to have the products required readiliy available at the right place in the right time at the most efficiet cost to maximize profitability. At this point it all depends on a single set of numbers which are shared by all functions and from which the detection of risks and opportunities for the chosen strategy are more clear and are identified with good timing. The single set of numbers is called the sales forecast and the process which makes this business allignment a reality is the "Sales and Operations Planning Process": S&OP.

The Opportunity: A Capable Demand Planning
It is critical to remember that one of the key reasons why the S&OP process to exist is to fulfill the customers' needs, and is clear that in any FMCG one of the biggest causes of failures in customer service are related to demand forecast inaccuracy. Both growth and profitability are compromised when the forecast is build through poor planning principles, as it creates a systemic bias which drains resources to higher costs, unnecessary inventories, and missed opportunities to grow with strategic customers.

The solution to this challenge is to create a Demand Plan, defined as "The best knowledge at a point in time about the expected volume requirements of all customers in a market, over a pre-defined time horizon." 

Addressing the challenge of creating a demand planning process which delivers a Capable Demand Planning will translate into delivering periodic Sales Forecast Accuracy (SFA) >75% and eliminating structural bias.

The Problem to be solved is: How to deliver a consensus demand plan that enables the whole organisation to deliver the expected growth and customer service levels?

Hypthesis 1: Demand plan accuracy will changes proportionally to the number of items (size of the portfolio) in each customer. e.g.: large portfolio will create a degradation of the accuracy, therefore there is an optimum portfolio size to maximize forecast accuracy

Hypothesis 2: Demand plan accuracy changes according to the seasonality. High consumption drives a different velocity of our items at the customer's shelf, therefore the planning basis and components of the plan have to be intified and adjusted depending on the time of the year

Hypothesis 3: Demand plan accuracy has a set of clusters which relate the customer type and / or other factors which impact the forecast accuracy of any given combinaion of item / customer
